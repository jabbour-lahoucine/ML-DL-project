Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

#Overview:

    This project uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical data. It involves data analysis, visualization, and model training to provide insights and accurate predictions.

#Features:

      Data cleaning and preprocessing
      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, pairplots, boxplots)
      Logistic Regression for prediction
      Performance evaluation with training and testing data splits

#Technologies Used:

    Python: Programming language
    Libraries:
        pandas for data manipulation
        numpy for numerical operations
        seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization
        scikit-learn for machine learning

#Project Workflow:

    Data Preprocessing:

        Handle missing values.
        Remove unnecessary columns.
        Normalize and clean the dataset.
        Exploratory Data Analysis:

    Visualize relationships and identify trends using heatmaps, count plots, and boxplots.

    Model Training:
    
        Train a logistic regression model to predict diabetes based on the features.
    
    Model Evaluation:

        Split the data into training and testing sets.
        Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like accuracy score.

#Results

        The logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 78%  on the test data.
        The model identifies key medical indicators that strongly correlate with diabetes.
